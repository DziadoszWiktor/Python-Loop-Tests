# **Python Loops Test**
We are going to test some methods in Python for the sum of numbers from 0 to n

## **1.** First experiment
In the first experiment are compared the for loop and the while loop 
</br></br>
![Test1](Screens/test1.PNG)</br>
**For loop is faster** cause the variable incrementation inside the loop is done in c, on the other hand, while condition and incrementations are done in python

## **2.** Second experiment
In this experiment are compared three different implementations of for loops with redundant operations
</br></br>

As we see, time increased...
## **3.** Third experiment
Third experiment is about comparsion of three different sum methods
</br></br>

## **4.** Fourth experiment 
Comparsion of some past tests
</br></br>
![Test4](Screens/test4.PNG)</br>
As we see, numpy method is faster than others (numpy is written in c too)</br></br>
**So the fastest way to loop in Python is to loop in C**</br>
